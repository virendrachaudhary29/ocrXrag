this is a project that works on pdf , it generates images of the pages of pdf and the text from the pdf. 
i used pypdfium2 to convert pdf to image and then i used easyocr to extract text from the image .
in future i will be adding rag system to the project and generate better ui to interact (theme will be minimal but beautiful) , and i will deploy this project after completion. 
right now due to time constraints(mid term exams ) i am not able to work with my full potential.
